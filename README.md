This is my Weather App, it is named weather-app-fail because it was my very first attempt at making it and I actually gave up on this, but I stuck with it.

This WeatherApp shows the dynamic data for the current day and a 7 day forecast, each showing values for City Name, air temperature, Feels like temperature, wind speed, humidity, and pressure.

I added a dynamic cloud cover based icon system that updates according to the cloud cover percentage given in the Stormglass.io API.

I added the convert Celsius to Fahrenheit buttons that only display the conversion once pressed in its own space, because the way I set up the code it originally took away the temperature values and would only display it once the toggle button was clicked, which messed up the aesthetic I had planned for this.

I will give you a hint, it is in plain sight but it is invisible and hidden behind something.

The current city search parameter is set to only show a min population over a 1,000,000. If you wish to change it, go to (Search.js -loadOptions) and remove this minPopulation=1000000& parameter for a broader city search.
